# CompSci Python References
"Never memorize what you can look up in books" is a quote attributed to Einstein, unfortunately that may not truly be what he said and this certainly isn't a conventional book. 

Regardless, this is a collection of Python assignments and code I've had to write in order to earn my bachelors degree in Computer Science. I'm compiling it here as in my attempts to learn both Finnish AND Russian, as well as pick up professional certifications so I can get a job in today's floundering job market, I would likely forget some things that I've learned. Now, it's all neatly compiled in a repo. 

To attest the legitimacy of these assignments: I've earned my degree with a 3.92 GPA, with a B in Statistics and losing the occasional ones-and-twos in quizzes and tests knocking my GPA down some, so the points I've lost (likely) didn't come from these.
